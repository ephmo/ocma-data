# OCMA-Data

## Overview

**OCMA-Data** is a structured **Orthodox Calendar** dataset that provides JSON files for each liturgical day of the year, supporting both the **Old Calendar (Julian)** and the **New Calendar (Revised Julian)** from 1924 to 2099. This dataset serves as the foundation for the [OCMA](https://github.com/ephmo/ocma) application, offering comprehensive liturgical details.

## Features

- **Feasts**: Movable and Fixed Feasts.
- **Saints**: Common and Additional Saints.
- **Fasting**: Information on Fasting Seasons and Levels.
- **Lectionary**: Tone, Matins Gospel, Epistle and Gospel for each Sunday.
- **Paschalion**: Pascha date for each year.
- **Moon Phases**: Primary lunar phases relevant to the Calendar.

## Multilingual Support & Translation-Friendly Structure

**OCMA-Data** is available in **English, Greek, Romanian and Russian**, with each language stored in **separate JSON files**. This separation ensures a clear distinction between **liturgical logic** and **language**, allowing easy expansion to additional languages in the future.

The JSON files provide structured and reusable data, making **OCMA-Data** a valuable resource for:

- **Developers** building applications with Orthodox liturgical content.
- **Researchers** studying Orthodox calendars and feast calculations.
